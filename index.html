        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p id="desc-mobile">I’m a Web Developer and Tech Administrator with practical experience in building modern,
                    responsive applications using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and popular frontend frameworks. Alongside
                    this, I bring a solid foundation in Java and Spring for backend development, giving me the ability
                    to contribute across the full stack.

                    During my professional work and internships, I’ve designed and developed responsive websites,
                    improved SEO performance, enhanced user experience, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to
                    deliver reliable, commercial-grade web solutions. By working closely with designers, backend
                    developers, and stakeholders, I’ve gained a strong understanding of how to translate business needs
                    into effective digital products.

                    My background extends beyond pure development. With experience in administration, media production,
                    and customer-facing roles, I bring creativity, organizational skills, and clear communication into
                    every project. This diverse perspective allows me to approach technical challenges with both
                    analytical and user-centric thinking.

                    I’m passionate about building scalable, user-friendly applications and thrive in collaborative
                    environments where knowledge-sharing and problem-solving are at the forefront. Constantly learning
                    and adapting, I’m eager to take on complex challenges that push my skills further while delivering
                    meaningful solutions.</p>
