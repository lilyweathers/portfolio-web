        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <div class="projects">
            <p class="text-projects">I have worked on a diverse range of projects across web development, programming,
                and creative media,
                combining technical expertise with a creative mindset.

                During my internship at Just Value AB, I contributed to the development and optimization of several
                commercial websites, including Just Value, Umami Sushi, Massageterapeuterna, and Handig STHLM. My role
                involved not only frontend development—focusing on responsive design, SEO, and user experience—but also
                supporting backend functionality, where I gained hands-on experience with Java, Spring, and database
                integration. This allowed me to work on both client-facing features and the underlying systems that
                support
                them, giving me a strong understanding of full-stack development.

                Beyond my internship, I continue to build applications and experiment with new technologies. I actively
                work
                with Java, Spring Boot, and RESTful APIs on the backend, while also exploring JavaScript, Node.js, and
                SQL
                to strengthen my server-side programming skills. Some of these projects are showcased on my GitHub,
                where I
                document my learning process and share real-world implementations.

                Alongside my technical background, I also bring experience in videography and media production, having
                worked as a camera operator, editor, and producer. This creative foundation has taught me to approach
                projects with both technical precision and an eye for storytelling. A selection of my visual work can be
                found on my Vimeo portfolio.
